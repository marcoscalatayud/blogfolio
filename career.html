          <p>I was one of the 4 designers at <a href="//qatium.app">Qatium</a>, <em>An easy-to-use water management software for utilities of any size</em>, with people distributed all over the world.</p>
          <p>Each area of the product had assigned a team with a designer, a water engineer, and some developers. These teams worked shoulder to shoulder, reaching agreements on how to develop each feature and pairing most of the time via video calls and screen-sharing.</p>
          <p>This way we could continuously deploy improvements that allowed us to gather feedback and iterate quickly.</p>
          <p>My main accomplishments were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Accessibility</b>: raise awareness on the topic and help to fully comply with WCAG 2.2 before June 2025.</li>
            <li><b>GUI design</b>: adopt an 8 point grid; prototype a light theme version of the app.
            </li>
            <li><b>GUI engineering</b> retrofit a responsive design versions to make the app fit in mobile devices; tokenize variables for easier development.</li>

            <p>I built the HTML+CSS templates for several websites following a selection of good practices: it was semantic, accessibility friendly, responsive, made use of custom properties, etc.</p>

          <p>ninety nine wanted to develop an online broker that everyone could use.
          <p>The team agreed on building an MVP to learn and iterate as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>I was involved in the end to end of the design process: analyzing the requirements, studying the competitors, defining the acceptance criteria, drawing workflows and wireframes, and building the UI.</p>
          <p>The most enjoyable part of the job was collaborating with the Compliance and Operations directors to reach a balance and build a comfortable product, mitigating the inconveniences of regulation (wait times, KYC, AML, etc).</p>

          <p>Umanick provided biometric and ID verification for other businesses.</p>
          <p>When I joined, they were starting to build a new suite of software. However, I quickly realized that the scope of the project was too ambitious for the expected deadline. Thus I suggested putting off some parts and focusing on the essential ones. That way we could release a first viable version and then iterate.</p>
          <p>I drafted workflows and user interfaces to validate them with stakeholders before coding the views in FXML (JavaFX) and CSS. To help keep a consistent interface, I also built a style guide and an icon family for the software.</p>

          <p>Rankia was the leading financial community in Spain. After years of exponential growth it faced some major challenges: lack of maintenance and consistency in both design and front-end code; and lack of responsive versions (in 2016).</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Auditing the current visual design and detecting its major flaws.</li>
            <li>Leading the creation of a style-guide for design and front-end code.</li>
            <li>Setting up several improvements in the front-end development pipeline.</li>

          <p>As a result:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We gave consistency and coherence to the visual design.</li>
            <li>We began to deploy responsive versions of the site.</li>
