      <h1>Let’s be honest</h1>
      <p><b>Honesty is the basis of good communication</b>. In an asynchronous, semi-bidirectional process such as this one it’s going to be fundamental. So let’s start by being honest.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>This hiring process is going to be overwhelming and surpass any expectations you had. <b>You are going to have a hard time deciding who passess to the next stage</b>. You may even feel like promoting the best ones who didn’t get the role.</li>
        <li>Every one of us aspiring to get the job admires your company, your philosophy, and your products. And <b>the one you hire will get more from your company than they will be able to offer</b>. I, for one, am looking forward to learning more about your processes -particularly methodologies such as jobs-to-be-done or breadboarding, with Ryan Singer.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>With that being said, I’ll do my best to present myself. <b>Let’s start, shall we?</b></p>

        <h2>What I do and how I do it</h2>
        <p>For ground-up new work I follow a similar process as the one Jesse James Garrett layed out in &ldquo;The Elements of User Experience&rdquo;. But <b>this process is adaptable to the circumstances</b> and most of the time we all end up doing just the last steps due to either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many times the <b>first research steps can be reused</b> with minor tweaks for further iterations in the UI implementation.</li>
          <li>The <b>common misbelief that <a href="https://marcos-calatayud.com/blog/on-deadlines/">rushed work</a> will be ready earlier</b> than planified good work. Forgetting that <b>the earlier the stage you detect design flaws, the cheaper they are to fix</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The honest, common, process <b>could be summarised as an iteration of</b>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gathering knowledge.</li>
          <li>Getting my hands dirty.</li>
          <li>Evaluate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Gathering knowledge</h3>
        <p>Interviewing both stakeholders and users is key; I like to have a clear picture of the goals.</p>
        <p>Every decision I make is based upon what I learn in this step and criteria I have been learning throughout the years. And when in doubt or conscious-ignorance, <b>I do not hesitate and ask for advice with my colleagues</b>, articles, or books.</p>

        <h3>Getting my hands dirty</h3>
        <p>When preparing &ldquo;deliverables&rdquo;, I go from sketches, to wireframes, to HTML+CSS+JS prototypes. I skip high fidelity mockups because:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I believe that <b>the best designers know the medium they’re working for</b>, because the medium provides another <a href="https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/03.4-embrace-constraints">constraint</a> which helps <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01#shaping-the-work">shape</a> the product.</li>
          <li>And, honestly, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1061-why-we-skip-photoshop">I always skipped Photoshop</a> because <b>I learnt it from you at the start of my career</b>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Static mockups for a desktop sized viewport don’t tell you how will the design scale to a narrower view or how it works in a smartphone. It’s better having a design system -or at least a styleguide- that sets the graphical direction and prototype with them in mind.</p>

        <p>Because of that, and to help me bring my designs to life, <b>I learnt to code frontend back in the day and I have kept doing so</b>: HTML + CSS + vanilla JS prototypes coded with semantic, BEM (or any other namespacing), accessible, micro-data, responsive, pre-post-processed CSS, etc. Except for the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">JS framework trend which raises the learning curve quite a lot</a>. Although I can manage myself in updating react code, I have yet to learn to code in react. <b>I prefer more traditional templating</b>, that’s why my site is coded with Jekyll.</p>

        <p><b>That doesn’t mean I’m afraid of going out of my comfort zone</b>. <a href="https://marcos-calatayud.com/blog/reasons-to-build-your-own-blog/">I built this website to actually show that I can get outside my comfort zone</a>: configuring AWS was certainly quite painful to me. I could have gone with the easy route of the prebuilt options on many hostings but:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I wanted maximum performance.</li>
          <li>It would have been less funny.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For the record, speaking of being outside your comfort zone, I’ve also coded PDF documents and emails in HTML+CSS. Oh, and don’t forget I can also write code fully compatible with IE11. Check out the latest version of my latest project <a href="https://allfunds.com">https://allfunds.com</a>. But don’t mind the code, we were rushed to an extreme [nervous laughter].</p>

        <h2>Ethic design</h2>
        <p>I believe that <b>we are responsible of the products we make</b> and that we must make them as healthy and accessible to everyone as possible.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For starters, dark patterns should be vanished and also regulated.</li>
          <li><b>Accessibility should be required by law</b>. At least for big budget companies. While we get there, if I detect some possible issue in a11y in a design I politely inform the designer/coder and teach him/her how to fix it.</li>
          <li>Also, <b>I don’t believe in tracking or vanity metrics</b>, so I <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-last-tracker-was-just-removed-from-basecamp-com/">completely removed</a> Google Analytics <a href="https://github.com/marcoscalatayud/blogfolio/commit/ee7db9c44a1bf7ede994527fbca1ab1b2090321e">from my site</a>.

        <h2>Recent work cases</h2>

        <h4>Aureka</h4>
        <p>Along 5 years, I got to improve the UX in several ways. You can <a href="https://marcos-calatayud.com/case-studies/aureka/">check out the case study for aureka</a> in my blogfolio.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Declutter the vbulletin-like user interface.</li>
          <li>Built a FAQ question to both help the users and lighten the workload for the Support team.</li>
          <li>Increase the base font size from 13px to 16px.</li>
          <li>Make use of vertical rhythm to increase reading comfort.</li>
          <li>Improve copywriting together with the editors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Ninetynine</h4>
        <p>Here I had one of the most <a href="https://marcos-calatayud.com/blog/designing-in-a-regulated-industry/">enjoyable challenges</a>. It had all of the good parts: hard constraints, good teammates, good solution for users.</p>
        <p>To build an authorized online broker, the Legal mate and I worked shoulder to shoulder to comply with all the <b>strict regulations</b> regarding money regulations (IRS, anti-money-laundering, etc) while <b>making the experience with the app and the user’s money (an especially sensitive area) as seamless as possible</b>.</p>
        <p><b>The regulation was (is) so strict it felt like a sudoku!</b> Really fun!</p>

        <h2>Why I want in</h2>
        <p>I know the <b>chance of getting hired for this role is one in a million</b>. But so it was getting hired for another dream company like Nintendo; check the <a href="https://youtu.be/5OTKac8Vn0g?t=740">credits of Wario Ware: Smooth Moves (YouTube)</a>. Even my wife, as supportive as she is, doubts I’ll even get to the next phase.</p>
        <p>These are my reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I want to be in a company where I can <b>grow as a designer</b>. Work with the best in a company where <b>design is not an afterthought</b>.</li>
          <li>I want to be in a company that builds products that really <b>improve people’s life</b>. I used basecamp early on in my career, but had to change to PITA like jira. Now, HEY is a very promising iteration on the usually cumbersome email management.</li>
          <li>I want to be in a company that is <b>not afraid of openly <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1272972718384623616">critiquing one of the most important companies</a> in the world</b>.</li>
          <li>I want to be in <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1187183814537293825">a company that encourages staff stability</a>, and basecamp is known for it.</li>

            <blockquote>
              <p>During one’s professional career there’s always the opportunity for meeting many different people. But only a handful of individuals become a fundamental part of your views and experiences, imprinting their perspectives on your own.</p>
              <p>If I had to point to the few people that, in over two decades, have had that kind of deeply significant impact on me, Marcos would be undoubtedly one of them. We not only keep a healthy personal relation, but we have also developed a lot of professional respect. During the years I worked together with Marcos — I, as developer and, later, as the technical lead; he, as designer and UX expert —, I was lucky to accumulate a lot of shared experiences and suggestions about UX and design: how to build proper forms, what words to use depending on the audience or how to use the colour palette in a consistent way; and many other tips.</p>
              <p>I currently work for a big corporation in an internal project in which design/frontend is unfortunately not considered fundamental from the business perspective. But I have to admit that I every day miss someone like Marcos to guide us and help us drive our application to a higher stage. This is the absolute truth: if it ever depends on me and if I ever have the chance, I'll do my best to not let him escape.</p>
