_This post is part of a series of posts thanking everyone who help (or helped) me improve my knowledge and skills on design and development._

As any visitor can see, I write very sparingly. There are two main reasons: I simply prefer to spend the time doing something else; I only want to write things that can endure the passing of time as gracefully as possible.

Luckily, we live in a day and age where quality information is readily available cheap and fast. You have many options to learn from the best: reading articles, books, watching videos, tutorials, examples...

Here you have a list of the people who unknowingly have helped me shape my perspective on product design. Here you have a list of *my teachers*.

### Edward Tufte

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Data visualization</p>

I consider myself a minimalist designer because I believe that data –usually text, charts in this context– must be clear and direct. That usually means getting read of -often involutary- distractions. When I learnt the concept of [data-ink ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte#Work) it hit me hard. It is beyond minimalism and makes information gathering fast.

### Don Norman

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Design, usability, philosophy</p>

Even though he is not kneen on the term, he's considered the pioneer on User eXperience Design. His book [The design of everyday things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) is an ageless must read, not only to "designers" but to anyone building a product.

### John Maeda

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Design, usability, minimalism</p>

His book [The laws of simplicity](https://lawsofsimplicity.com) is a very coherent work (is actually a really short easy-to-read but powerful book) which can be used as a heuristic –others would call it "cheat sheet", or check list- to analyze the usability of your digital product.

### Steve Krug

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Design, usability</p>

He successfully made usability a hot topic in product design. The popularity of his book [Don't make me think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Make_Me_Think) (whose title is a perfect summary) made everyone in the chain of product building aware of potential usability issues.

### 37signals

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Philosophy</p>

I bought [Getting real](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal) because I already enjoyed reading their posts. It was eye-opening and helped me question outdated concepts acquired throughout my degree.

### Ryan Singer (ex 37signals)

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Design, research, philosophy</p>

To me, he is one of the most insightful design-researchers in the digital product design field; always trying to improve the problem-to-solution process and [openly sharing his solutions](https://www.feltpresence.com).

### Oliver Reichenstein

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Usability, philosophy</p>

I recall his post on making [a 100% readable web](https://ia.net/topics/100e2r) (2006) as a milestone for web. His subsequent posts studying the differences of reading on a screen or a book are also worthy.

### Luke Wroblewski

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Design, usability</p>

He wrote a post in 2015 titled [Obvious always wins](https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945). The title is self-explanatory but many designers, and stakeholders with a say in their product's design, should still take a good note on this and many of Luke's articles.
