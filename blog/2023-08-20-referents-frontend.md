_This post is part of a series of posts thanking everyone who helps (or helped) me improve my knowledge and skills on design and development._

<!--
As any visitor can see, I write very sparingly. There are two main reasons: I simply prefer to spend the time doing something else; I only want to write things that can endure the passing of time as gracefully as possible.

Luckily, we live in a day and age where quality information is readily available cheap and fast. You have many options to learn from the best: reading articles, books, watching videos, tutorials, examples...

Here you have a list of the people who unknowingly have helped me shape my perspective on frontend coding. Here you have a list of *my frontend teachers*.

You can also check my [design referents](/blog/2023-08-14-referents-design).

### Eric Meyer

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">CSS</p>

He wrote [CSS: The definitive guide](//www.oreilly.com/library/view/css-the-definitive/9781098117603/). That's the go-to resource I recommend for anyone asking to learn CSS. Reading it's second edition is basically how taught me CSS.

Among many other contributions, he's also known his [CSS Meyer's reset](//meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset).

### Peter-Paul Koch

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Technical info</p>

Back in the olden days, before [caniuse.com](//caniuse.com), we all went to his site [quirksmode.org](//quirksmode.org) to check if what we were writing in our stylesheets was going to have [compatibility](//www.quirksmode.org/css/) issues.

### Lea Verou

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">CSS<sup>2</sup></p>

She shared advanced clever techniques to go beyond on styling. I keep using her [CSS scrolling shadows with background-attachment: local](//lea.verou.me/blog/2012/04/background-attachment-local/) from 2012! She has published many other [useful design / CSS projects](//lea.verou.me/projects/) at her site.

### Sara Soueidan

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">SVG, accessibility</p>

She has written many amazing articles on advanced use of SVG and CSS, with a special focus on accessibility. An essential [blog](//www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/) for your RSS feed.

### Ben Frain

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Frontend tooling</p>

I think I discovered him when looking for help on static frontend development and ended up in one of his thorough articles about [middleman](//benfrain.com/understanding-middleman-the-static-site-generator-for-faster-prototyping/). But the work that has had the most impact on me is the creation my preferred namespacing for HTML/CSS classnames: [ECSS](//ecss.benfrain.com). Forget BEM or any other!

### Jeffrey Zeldman

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Web standards</p>

Zeldman was a referent for the web industry early on, specially pushing for the use of we standards. But I knew him through one of his projects, [A list apart](//www.alistapart.com/) &mdash; one of the best sites to learn about design and development in any of its subareas.

### Chris Coyier

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">CSS thesaurus</p>

He built [CSS-Tricks](//css-tricks.com). For the name you could guess its content, but it goes far beyond "simple" tricks, it's packed with comprehensive guides on many things CSS related. He also co-founded [codepen](//codepen.io), a useful tool for creating and sharing useful dev snippets, learning, or just bragging about your dev skills (check [CSS-Tricks Spark](//codepen.io/spark)).

### Rachel Andrew

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Layout</p>

Throughout her career, Andrew has published some of the best articles on mastering layout with CSS.

### Jen Simmons

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">Layout</p>

Currently working at Apple on the Web Developer Experience team for Safari & Webkit; and a member of CSS Working Group. She previously blowed many peoples minds with her layout techniques during her talks. For instance: [Intrinsic layouts](//youtube.com/watch?v=AMPKmh98XLY)

### Miriam Suzanne

<p class="mc-Post_Meta">CSS at the edge</p>

She's a core contributor to [Sass](//sass.org). Her [articles on cutting edge frontend techniques]() with [incoming CSS improvements](//www.miriamsuzanne.com/tags/css/) are a great way to be up to date.
